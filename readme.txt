    # Library Management System

This is a simple Library Management System built in C++ that allows users to manage a collection of books. The program supports adding books to the library, viewing all books, lending out books, returning lent books, and saving/loading the library data to/from a file.

The system uses C++ features like classes, vectors, file I/O, and user interaction to provide an efficient way of managing a small library.

## Features

- **Add a Book**: Allows the user to add a new book to the library with details such as book ID, title, and author.
- **View All Books**: Displays all books in the library with their status (available or lent out).
- **Lend a Book**: Lends out a book to a user if it is available.
- **Return a Book**: Marks a book as returned if it was previously lent out.
- **Save and Load Library Data**: Saves the current state of the library to a file and loads the data back when the program restarts.
